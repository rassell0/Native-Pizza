# Native-Pizza

Pizza Deliver app made with react native and firebase. Just a clone of the papa johns mobile app. I wanted to create a application from scratch without help of a tutorial so i decided to use the papa johns app for inspiration. This was the biggest project ive built yet. The front end wasn't to complicated. connecting the backend and displaying it in a specific way was the most complicated part. This took about a week to make but im pround of the project. The next step would me to finish the carryout feature. I'd need to find an api witht he locations of each location. Also a rewards tab but i was thinking since this is just a dummy application not for actual use there wouldnt be a need for that.
